        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            HTML elements define the content and the framework of a webpage.
          </li>
          <li>HTML code has semantic and non-semantic elements.</li>
          <li>
            Semantic HTML elements are favoured because the name of the element
            describes the role it plays.
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-semantic HTML is used when it is the most efficient solution to
            a structural problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            HTML elements usually have an opening and closing tag within angle
            brackets (<>).
          </li>
          <li>
            The closing tag includes a forward slash (/) after the opening
            angled bracket (<).
          </li>
          <li>The content is inserted between the opening and closing tags.</li>
          <li>
            HTML code opens with the line !DOCTYPE html inside angled brackets.
          </li>
          <li>
            The !DOCTYPE html declaration tells the browser what document type
            it should expect when it is opened.
          </li>
          <li>Second, we have html lang="en" for webpages in english.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>
            The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.
          </li>
          <li>
            The meta element defines metadata such as the character set,
            description, keywords, author and viewpoint.
          </li>
          <li>The link element connects an external HTML document.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>
            The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.
          </li>
          <li>The div element is used to create a division in the page.</li>
          <li>The span element is used to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>
            Heading elements h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 range is size with h1
            being most prominent.
          </li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The ul element represents unordered lists.</li>
          <li>The ol element represents ordered lists.</li>
          <li>The li element represents list items.</li>
          <li>
            The img element contains information about images that are
            displayerd on the webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            The img elements contain various attributes, most cimportantly the
            src attribute which defines the location of the imagae.
          </li>
          <li>
            The br element crated a line of empty space, or a line break between
            two blocks of content.
          </li>
          <li>
            The a element stands for anchor, which creates links to the same
            webpage or other webpages.
          </li>
          <li>
            The opening tag for this includes a href= followed by your link.
          </li>
          <li>
            The footer element appears at the botom of the page and usually
            includes the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to add style to a webpage.</li>
          <li> Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS Style Sheet embeds an entire style sheet directly into the HTML file, in the style tag element, within the head element.</li>
          <li>External Style Sheets links a file using a link element placed in the HTML's head element.</li>
          <li> External Style Sheet is the prefewrred method, as it makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>CSS Rule includes a selector and one or more properties with their values in the declaration block.</li>
          <li> Selector: defines the element or attribute to which the rules, or declarations apply.</li>
          <li>Declaration: Includes the property(ex: colour) we want to apply the value to, and the value (ex: blue). </li>
          <li>Example: Selector { Property: Value; Property: Value;}.</li>
          <li>CSS rules can apply to more than one selector (ex: header and footer) by adding a comma between the desired selectors.</li>
          <li>Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
          <li>To apply a rule to all of the visible elements on the page we use a * as the selector</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.</li>
          </li>
          <li>
            A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            an element.
          </li>
          <li>Assiging colours in CSS can be done semantically (ex: blue, grey...) or by using your desired colours hex #.</li>
