        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <br><h4>Definition</h4></br>
          <li>
            <b>HTML</b> elements define the content and the framework of a webpage.
          </li>
          <br><h4>Types</h4></br>
          <li>
            <b>Semantic HTML</b> includes elements where the name of the element
            describes the role it plays (ex:header).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Non-semantic HTML</b> includes elements where the name does not decribe the role it plays (ex: div).
          </li>
            <li>
              <b>Non-semantic HTML</b> is used when it is the most efficient solution to
            a structural problem.
          </li>
          <li><b>Semantic HTML</b> is preferred as it makes it easier to understand the code and collaborate.</li>
          <br><h4>Getting Started</h4></br>
          <li>
            HTML elements usually have an opening and closing tag within angle
            brackets (<>).
          </li>
          <li>
            The closing tag includes a forward slash (/) after the opening
            angled bracket (<).
          </li>
          <li>The content is inserted between the opening and closing tags.</li>
          <li>
            HTML code opens with the line !DOCTYPE html inside angled brackets.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <b>!DOCTYPE html</b> declaration tells the browser what document type
            it should expect when it is opened.
          </li>
          <li>Second, we have <b>html lang="en"</b> for webpages in english.</li>
          <br> <h4>The Elements</h4></br>
          <li>The <b>head</b> element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>
            The <b>body</b> element represents the visible content shown to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <b>style</b> element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <b>meta</b> element defines metadata such as the character set,
            description, keywords, author and viewpoint.
          </li>
          <li>The <b>link</b> element connects an external HTML document.</li>
          <li>The <b>base</b> element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>
            The <b>script</b> element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.
          </li>
          <li>The <b>div</b> element is used to create a division in the page.</li>
          <li>The <b>span</b> element is used to create an inline division.</li>
          <li>
            Heading elements <b>h1, h2, h3, h4, h5</b> and <b>h6</b> range is size with h1
            being most prominent.
          </li>
          <li>The <b>p</b> element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The <b>ul</b> element represents unordered lists.</li>
          <li>The <b>ol</b> element represents ordered lists.</li>
          <li>The <b>li</b> element represents list items.</li>
          <li>
            The <b>img</b> element contains information about images that are
            displayerd on the webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            The img elements contain various attributes, most cimportantly the
            <b>src</b> attribute which defines the location of the imagae.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <b>br</b> element crated a line of empty space, or a line break between
            two blocks of content.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <b>a</b> element stands for anchor, which creates links to the same
            webpage or other webpages.
          </li>
          <li>
            The opening anchor tag includes a <b>href=</b> followed by your link.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <b>footer</b> element appears at the botom of the page and usually
            includes the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.
            <br></br>

          <br><h4>Definition</h4></br>
          <li><b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is used to add style to a webpage.</li>
          <br><h4>Types</h4></br>
          <li> <b>Inline CSS</b> is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li><b>Internal CSS Style Sheet</b> embeds an entire style sheet directly into the HTML file, in the style tag element, within the head element.</li>
          <li><b>External Style Sheets</b> links a file using a link element placed in the HTML's head element.</li>
          <li> <b>External Style Sheet</b> is the preferred method, as it makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li><b>External stylesheets</b> are linked between the head tags of the html using the link element.</li>
          <br><h4>Getting Started</h4></br>
          <li><b>CSS Rule</b> includes a selector and one or more properties with their values in the declaration block.</li>
          <li> <b>Selector</b> defines the element or attribute to which the rules, or declarations apply.</li>
          <li><b>Declaration</b> includes the property(ex: colour) we want to apply the value to, and the value (ex: blue). </li>
          <li>Example: Selector { Property: Value; Property: Value;}.</li>
          <li>CSS rules can apply to more than one selector (ex: header and footer) by adding a comma between the desired selectors.</li>
          <li>Rather than repeating a rule which would add more lines of code and repetition, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.</li>
          <li>To apply a rule to all of the visible elements on the page we use a <b>*</b> as the selector</li>
          <li><b>CSS box model</b> describes every HTML element essentially being a box that consists of margins outside the element, the element's boarders, padding and content.</li>
            <li>A <b>margin</b> indicates how much space we want around the outside of an
            element.</li>
          </li>
          <li>
            A <b>padding</b> indicates how much space we want around the content inside
            an element.
          </li>
          <li>Assiging colours in CSS can be done semantically (ex: blue, grey...) or by using your desired colours hex #. These can found on this <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/" target="blank">HTML Colour Codes Website</a></li>

          <li><b>Git</b> is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          
          <br><h4>Getting Started</h4></br>
          <li><b>Git</b> is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer, but to collaborate with others, you need to use another tool like <b>GitHub.</b></li>
          <li><b>GitHub</b> is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li>Using <b>GitHub</b> not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others.</li>
          <li><b>GitHub</b> is connected to <b>Git</b>, which is software on your computer that tracks changes that you make to your code.</li>
          <li>Your local machine can be connected to your <b>GitHub</b> using your <b>SSH keys.</b></li>
          <li>To acess <b>Git</b>, we use the command line or terminal.</li>
          <br><h4>GitHub Terminology</h4></br>
          <li><b>Repository (repo)</b> a folder in which all files and their version are stored.</li>

          <li><b>Pull Request (PR)</b> the way to ask for changes made to a branch to be merged into another branch that also allows for multiple users to see, discuss and review work being done.</li>
